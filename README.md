Hangman from The Odin Project

Attempting to:
  - Read/Write a save/load game file
    - Serialize the Game class
  - Continue focusing on better OOP Design

What I learned:
  - YAML is incredibly simple
    - Don't try parsing string, just load into the object
  - Reading/Writing to file

What I need to improve:
  - OOP Design
    - Need to read Sandi Metz's book(s)
  - Shorter methods
    - Either need to break them down more or find ways to write fewer lines for what I'm trying to accomplish
